# GithubFinder - Ajax and jQuery

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and view related information like repositories, followers, and more. The app uses Ajax requests and jQuery for handling the GitHub API and dynamically updating the interface with user data.

## :dart: About ##

The GithubFinder project is built with JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax to interact with the GitHub API. It fetches data asynchronously from the GitHub API based on user input (username) and displays the profile details, including repositories, followers, and other public information.

## :sparkles: Features ##

- **Real-time GitHub Profile Search**: Search for any GitHub user by username.
- **Profile Data Display**: View user profile information such as name, bio, repositories, followers, and following.
